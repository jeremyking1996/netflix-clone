# My Netflix Clone!

I attempted to create a reactive Netflix clone using React.js. I used Material UI for the icons and pulled the data from one of Netflix API. I attempted to give it the ability to display the trailers upon clicking but it would play every video trailer at once instead of all of them. Utilized React Hooks and Axios to use the API data that was being passed to the server.
